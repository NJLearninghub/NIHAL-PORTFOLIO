        <h2>Why I chose this path</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        <p>My journey into education and guidance was not a straight line — it was shaped by ambition, setbacks, and a persistent gap I kept encountering.</p>

        <p>I was selected in the extended merit list of JEE Advanced (2009) on my second attempt, and later reached the conference-out stage in the Indian Air Force selection process. Both experiences demanded discipline, resilience, and self-belief — yet they also exposed a harsh reality.</p>

        <p>What held me back was not effort or intent, but lack of timely, authentic guidance. Decisions were often made with incomplete information, limited mentorship, and an over-reliance on hearsay. Once those phases passed, I never attempted them again — not due to lack of capability, but due to the absence of clarity at the right moment.</p>

        <p>Ironically, today’s students face the opposite problem. Information is abundant — courses, videos, opinions, AI tools — yet the core issue remains unchanged: a lack of structured, trustworthy guidance. Too much information without direction often creates more confusion than confidence.</p>

        <p>This realization defines my work today. I operate in this domain to ensure students don’t struggle the way many of us did — not because resources were unavailable, but because guidance was absent or fragmented. Through education, AI tools, and career clarity systems, I aim to help learners make informed decisions with confidence, context, and conscience.</p>

        <p>This is my small but sincere contribution — to reduce confusion, restore clarity, and make guidance more human, structured, and accessible.</p>
